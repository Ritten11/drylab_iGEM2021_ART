Absorbance files
---------------------------
There are 15 .txt files that show absorbance at 15 different time-points. The files are named as hh.mm.txt where hh corresponds to the hour and m corresponds to the minute of the time-point at which the measurement was recoreded (e.g. the file 19.02.txt was recored at 19:02).

For the first 4 time-points, the absorbance values were entered manually. Only the absorbance values of the relevant wells were entered, the values of the wells that are not relevant are set to 0.


---------------------------
OD and plate arrangement
---------------------------
The "OD and Well Plate Arrangement.xlsx" file contains the OD values and shows the arrangement of the well plate.

The OD values are located int the "OD" sheet. The values in the column C ("OD (stadardized)") should be used.

The well plate arrangement is located in the "Well Plate Arrangement" sheet. Please note that the third triplicate of the sample #34 is located in C9 (instead of E9).

Both sheets are also exported as .csv files for easy integration into the ART-pipeline as respectively "plate_arrangements.csv" and "OD_standerdized.csv"
---------------------------

All raw data is located in the folder "Raw".
